#  Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project demonstrates **time-series sales forecasting** using synthetic tractor sales data (Punjab, 2023–2024).  
The objective was to simulate a real-world business scenario and build models that predict future sales by capturing **seasonality, demand fluctuations, and long-term trends**.
